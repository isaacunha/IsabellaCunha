Hello, welcome!

I studied cartography and surveying engineering at UNESP.
I know some technologies like JAVA, HTML, CSS, Python and geotechnologies softwares.
I'm a masters student in Agricultural Engineering at UNICAMP in the precision agriculture area.
I am curious to learn new things and I am looking to collaborate in whatever I can.
